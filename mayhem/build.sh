# mayhem/build.sh — build this repo's fuzz harness(es). EDIT per repo.
#
# Runs inside the commit image (mayhem/Dockerfile) as `mayhem` in /mayhem. The base image
# (ghcr.io/mayhemheroes/base) already exports the build contract — use these, don't redefine:
#   CC, CXX             stock clang / clang++
#   LIB_FUZZING_ENGINE  -fsanitize=fuzzer   (link into each harness that has a LLVMFuzzer entry)
#   SANITIZER_FLAGS     -fsanitize=address,undefined -fno-sanitize-recover=all -fno-omit-frame-pointer
#                       (ASan + UBSan, both set to HALT — so Mayhem catches memory AND UB defects)
#   DEBUG_FLAGS         -g -gdwarf-3   (DWARF debug info — always on for fuzz/standalone builds,
#                       independent of the sanitizer off-switch; DWARF version must be < 4)
#   RUST_DEBUG_FLAGS    -C debuginfo=2 -C force-frame-pointers=yes -C llvm-args=-gdwarf-3
#                       (thread through RUSTFLAGS on every cargo-fuzz build)
#   GO_DEBUG_FLAGS      -gcflags=all=-N -l
#                       (thread through go build / go-fuzz-build so the linked ELF keeps symbols)
#   SRC                 /mayhem (the repo source)

# Contract: build EVERYTHING here — one runnable binary per fuzz harness, AND the project's test
# suite (so mayhem/test.sh only has to RUN it, never compile). Keep it ADDITIVE (build upstream as
# upstream documents; don't edit upstream files). IMPORTANT: build the PROJECT ITSELF with
# $SANITIZER_FLAGS and $DEBUG_FLAGS (not just the harness) so the fuzzed code is instrumented
# AND carries DWARF < 4 symbols — otherwise ASan/UBSan only see the harness, not the library
# you're trying to find bugs in, and backtraces won't resolve project source lines. Build the TEST
# suite with the project's NORMAL flags (a clean, independent build) so test.sh stays an honest
# functional oracle and won't false-fail on benign UB. Leave the test binary/runner where test.sh
# expects it.

# Build knobs come from the ENVIRONMENT (overridable), with sane defaults — no if-statements,
# just parameter-expansion fallbacks. Default sanitizers are the base's ASan+UBSan (halting); override
# per build via the Dockerfile's `--build-arg SANITIZER_FLAGS="..."`.
# NB: SANITIZER_FLAGS uses `=` (no colon) on purpose — `=` only fills when the var is UNSET, so an
# explicit EMPTY value (`--build-arg SANITIZER_FLAGS=`) is honored and builds with NO sanitizers
# (useful when you want the program's natural crash / full backtrace, not an ASan report). The other
# knobs use `:=` (default on empty too). MAYHEM_JOBS sets build parallelism (falls back to nproc).

# builds (NOT the test/oracle build). Rust/Go carry the same intent via their language flags below.

# test build's compile+link flags in step 3 (NOT the fuzz build); after `test.sh` runs, merge with
# `llvm-profdata` and report with `llvm-cov`. Empty value is honored (`=`, not `:=`).
